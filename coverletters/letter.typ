Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Research Associate - MedTech position at HMC. As a Computer Science student with a passion
for applying computational methods to biological challenges, I am drawn to the opportunity to collaborate on QRDI-funded 
projects that bridge healthcare and technology. My work on an agent-based antibiotic resistance simulation - where I modeled
bacterial growth and pharmodynamic parameters - demonstrates my ability to translate complex biological interactions into 
scalable solutions. Though unpublished, this project was part of my Great Ideas in Computational Biology class at Carnegie
Mellon University.

*Technical Alignment:* My profiency in Python and C, coupled with coursework in AI for medicine and Computational Biology, 
has equipped me with the tools needed to develop robust MedTech solutions. Although my experience is with C, picking up C++
would not be too difficult and I have experience with object oriented programming with Java where I built a fault tolerant 
distributed file system.

*Why MedTech?* While my background is in CS, I am captivated by problems where technology can directly improve lives. Computational 
Biology coursework exposed me to DNA alignment and clustering techniques among other problems.

I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills could support your projects. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\ 
Talhah Peerbhai
